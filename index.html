  <!-- To open this webpage you can either select a live preview setting in your text editor (Ctrl/alt/p or cmd/alt/p in Brackets) or you can locate the index.html in Finder or Windows Explorer (like, where you open My Documents) and open that with Google Chrome --> 
  
  <!-- Below are Div Tags. A Div is a rectangular container that you can put things in, like text. With no CSS, we can't see the div because it has no color, height, or width, so we must change that. 

Note: It is possible to write CSS in this index.html file. We can do that through in-line syntax, which looks like this: <div style="height:100px; width:100px; color:#ace332;"></div> This is ok sometimes but not recommended as it's harder to find errors and it makes your rewrite code a lot. It's neater and easier to have a separate CSS file. -->

  <div id="first"></div>
  
  <!-- In this div we see two important attributes, an ID and a class. These help specify different styles and actions in your code. In CSS, you may style an HTML element with an id by selecting it using #id, and a class is selected by .class. There are examples of this in the CSS document. -->
  <div id="second" class="circle"></div>
  
  <!-- This is a div with an id of third -->
  <div id="third"></div>
